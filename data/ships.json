"description":"The mighty flagship of Darth Vader, the Executor led Death Squadron during the Empire’s assault on Hoth and pursued the Millennium Falcon to Bespin, where Luke Skywalker and his friends narrowly escaped her tractor beams. First commanded by Admiral Ozzel and later by Admiral Piett, the massive warship met her end during the Battle of Endor, when a rebel A-wing smashed through her command bridge. Out of control, the Executor careened into the Death Star and exploded.",

The Falcon looks like a worn-out junker, but beneath her hull she’s full of surprises. A succession of owners, from Lando Calrissian and Han Solo to Gannis Ducain, have made special modifications that boosted the freighter’s speed, shielding and firepower to impressive – and downright illegal – levels. The price of such tinkering? The Falcon can be unpredictable, with her hyperdrive particularly balky. Despite her flaws, she’s beloved by her owners – Han Solo and Chewbacca have spent years searching the galaxy for the ship they once called home.",
